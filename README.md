# 🌟 Problem 6: Read Directory Content 🌟

Welcome to the sixth challenge in the Node.js practical problem series! 🚀 In this problem, you’ll learn how to work with the **File System (fs)** module to read the contents of a directory and list all the files within it. 📂

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Write a Node.js script that reads the content of a directory and prints the names of all files in it to the console.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Learn to use the `fs.readdir` method to read directory contents.
- Understand the difference between files and directories.
- Explore asynchronous operations in Node.js and their practical applications.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Your project folder should look like this:

```bash
06-name-of-all-files-in-directory-node-problem/
├── script.js      # The script to read directory content
├── .git
├── README.md         # Documentation for this problem
└── package.json      # Project configuration file
```

---

## 🌟 Features to Enhance

Once you've completed the basics, try adding:

- File Type Detection: Distinguish between files and subdirectories.

- Recursive Reading: Traverse subdirectories and list their contents as well.

- Custom Directory Input: Use `process.argv` to specify a directory path dynamically.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to use Node.js's `fs` module to interact with the file system.

- The importance of handling asynchronous operations in Node.js.

- Techniques for handling errors while accessing the file system.
